## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

WTK Holdings Berhad is a Malaysian company primarily involved in timber and increasingly in oil palm plantations. Recent financial results show mixed performance, with revenue fluctuations and a shift from losses to profits in different quarters of 2025. The company is undertaking a significant RM555 million expansion into oil palm through acquisitions. Given these factors, a Business Expansion Loan and a Term Loan are potentially suitable to support their expansion plans. However, eligibility hinges on internal credit assessments and further due diligence.

## COMPANY ANALYSIS (from web sources)

    *   Credit score and credit history.

    *   Business plan outlining the projected revenue and expenses for the expanded oil palm operations.

-   **Key decision-makers to target:** Chief Financial Officer (Lilian Wong Zhi Hui) [Web Source 14], Executive Director (Lai Soon Ong) [Web Source 14], and other key members of the management team involved in the acquisition and expansion strategy.

## RISK FACTORS

    *   Review WTK's existing credit exposure with the bank.
    *   Assess the company's credit rating based on internal models.
    *   Check for any past compliance issues.
