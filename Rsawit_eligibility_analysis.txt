   1. Working Capital Loan
   2. Refinancing Facility
   3. SME Loan

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Rimbunan Sawit Berhad (RSAWIT) is a Sarawak-based oil palm plantation company. Recent financial results show increased revenue, but an auditor's statement of material uncertainty regarding its ability to continue as a going concern raises significant red flags. While revenue has increased, free cash flow is negative, and debt levels are a concern. Given the current financial instability, a conservative approach is necessary. A Working Capital Loan might be considered with caution, but a Refinancing Facility is unlikely to be suitable at this time. An SME Loan could be explored, but only after thorough due diligence.
