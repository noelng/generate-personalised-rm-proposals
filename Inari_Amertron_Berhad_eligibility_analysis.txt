## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Inari Amertron Berhad is a leading Malaysian technology company providing outsourced semiconductor assembly and testing (OSAT) services. While recent financial results show a decline in revenue and net income, the company is investing in advanced capabilities and pursuing strategic acquisitions like Lumileds to diversify its revenue streams and capitalize on growth opportunities in the semiconductor industry. Based on publicly available information, Inari Amertron appears to be a strong candidate for Equipment Financing and a Working Capital Loan. A Business Expansion Loan is also potentially suitable, but requires further verification of specific expansion plans and financial projections.
